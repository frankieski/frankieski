## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a qualified engineer with a strong technical background and a growing passion for software development.
For the past two years, Iâ€™ve been working at a manufacturing plant, where Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience solving real industrial tasks and optimizing processes.

Alongside my main work, Iâ€™ve been actively learning programming and expanding my skills in Go, Python, and C#. I enjoy applying my engineering mindset to write clean, efficient code for automation, data processing, and small tools that make daily tasks easier.

Iâ€™m focused, curious, and always ready to learn new technologies and best practices. My goal is to combine my engineering knowledge with strong programming skills to contribute to modern, practical solutions in production or IT fields.
